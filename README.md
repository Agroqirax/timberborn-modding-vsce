# Timberborn modding tools extension

This is an unofficial extension for modding timberborn.
It provides json validation, snippets, an automatic localizations translator and some other cool tools

## Installation

Install using vscode

```shell
code --install-extension agroqirax.timberborn-modding-ext
```

## Getting started

Most features work out-of-the-box but a few must be configured

- To use the automatic translator, localizations validator and localizations tooltip configure `timberbron-modding-ext.locFiles` in folder settings
- To use custom links configure `timberborn-modding-ext.docsLinks` in settings (optional). If you don't do this default links will be used.

## Features

- ‚úÖ Json validation & autocomplete
- ‚úèÔ∏è Json, csv, C# & TAPI snippets
- üöÄ Launch game command with custom launch config
- ‚ú® Localization translator (not perfect, always check translations!)
- üìñ Quick links to documentation with custom links
- üìÅ Project setup command
- üåç Localization keys validator & hover provider

## Ideas

- ü™µ Error log viewer
- üé® Timberborn theme
